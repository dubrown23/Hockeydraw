# Hockey Draw Update Log

---
## 06.11.2025 - Core Data Model Implementation & Feature Planning
- **Completed comprehensive feature planning session**:
  - Defined all player positions: RW, LW, C, RD, LD, F1-F3, D1-D2, G, CO
  - Specified preset formations: Standard, Power Play (P1-P5), Penalty Kill (K1-K4)
  - Established token size: ~24-28pt diameter (larger than face-off dots)
  - Confirmed free placement with no grid snapping or collision detection
- **Designed movement visualization system**:
  - Forward skating: Solid line with arrow
  - Backward skating: Angular C-shapes with arrow  
  - Skating with puck: Tight squiggles with arrow
  - Passing puck: Dotted line with arrow
  - Shooting puck: Double line with arrow
  - Single arrow at path end only
- **Implemented complete Core Data model**:
  - Created Drill entity with tags, name, isFavorite, duration attributes
  - Created DrillObject entity with type, teamColor, startPosition, positionLabel, hasPuck
  - Created DrillPath entity with pathData, skatingType, startTime, duration
  - Created DrillVariation entity for drill versions
  - Established all relationships with proper inverses and delete rules
- **Fixed Core Data configuration issues**:
  - Generated NSManagedObject subclasses for all entities
  - Resolved "ambiguous type" errors by setting Codegen to Manual/None
  - Addressed duplicate class definition conflicts
  - Transformer warnings remain (expected - to be handled during implementation)
- **Made key technical decisions**:
  - Hybrid approach: PencilKit for input capture, Core Graphics for custom line rendering
  - Timeline interface: GarageBand-style with individual player tracks
  - Auto-transitions: Pass received → "with puck", Shot/pass → "without puck"
  - Architecture: UIKit for precise control over SwiftUI
- **Established development roadmap**:
  - Phase 1: Object placement, path drawing, basic animation
  - Phase 2: Timeline controls, advanced animations, puck mechanics
  - Phase 3: Export functionality (video/PDF), drill templates
  - Phase 4: Variations, cloud sync, team sharing

## 06.11.2025 - Project Foundation & NHL Regulation Rink Implementation
- **Created new Xcode project "Hockey Draw"**:
  - Product Name: Hockey Draw
  - Organization Identifier: db23
  - Interface: Storyboard (UIKit for precise drawing control)
  - Language: Swift
  - Storage: Core Data
  - Target: iOS 18.0+ iPad only
- **Added required frameworks**:
  - PencilKit.framework (for Apple Pencil support)
  - AVFoundation.framework (for future video export)
- **Built complete NHL regulation ice rink rendering system**:
  - Created IceRinkView custom UIView class
  - Implemented precise 200ft x 85ft proportions (2.35:1 ratio)

  - Goal lines positioned 11ft from boards (5.5% of 200ft)
  - Blue lines positioned 75ft from boards (37.5% of 200ft)
  - Center circle: 15ft radius (17.6% of 85ft width)
  - Face-off circles: 15ft radius with proper positioning
  - Goal creases: 6ft radius extending toward center ice
  - Goals: 6ft x 4ft positioned correctly on goal lines
- **Achieved accurate visual representation**:

  - Face-off dots sized and positioned per specifications
  - Goal creases as blue semi-circles extending into rink from goal lines
  - Board lines drawn last for clean edge appearance
- **Fixed multiple positioning and rendering issues**:
  - Corrected goal crease direction (toward center ice, not toward boards)
  - Fixed board line z-ordering to appear on top of all other lines
  - Adjusted corner radius for authentic rink appearance
  - Scaled all elements to maintain proportions across iPad screen sizes
- **Established proper project structure**:
  - UIKit + Core Graphics architecture for precise control
  - MVC pattern with separation of concerns

  - Larger, filled arrowheads (16px length) for better visibility
- **UI improvements**:
  - Segmented control for line type selection
  - Clear button to reset canvas
  - Proper toolbar constraints and layout
  - Rounded line caps for smoother appearance
- **Technical achievements**:

## 06.16.2025 - Player Token System & Puck Implementation
- **Implemented complete player token placement system**:
  - Created PlayerToken class with 36pt diameter for better touch targets
  - Added drag & drop functionality with percentage-based positioning
  - Double-tap to change team color (red/blue)
  - Long press (0.8s) to delete tokens
- **Added mode toggle system**:
  - "Place" mode for adding players
  - "Draw" mode for creating movement paths
  - Long press in Draw mode selects player (yellow border)
  - Selected player's paths are highlighted
- **Implemented PuckToken system**:
  - Small black puck with white border
  - Double-tap player to assign puck
  - Puck follows player with "W/ Puck" movement
  - Puck releases on "Pass" or "Shoot" paths
- **Fixed Apple Pencil support**:
  - Long press now works with both finger and Apple Pencil
  - Added allowedTouchTypes for proper pencil recognition
- **Added basic animation system**:
  - Play button animates tokens along their paths
  - Animation resets to beginning when complete
  - Sequential path support (but needs fixing)
- **Known Issues**:
  - Token follows squiggly path instead of centerline
  - Sequential animations (skate then shoot) not working properly
  - Need way to connect paths at arrow endpoints

- Will be properly handled when implementing save/load features
- No blocking issues for development

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose UIKit over SwiftUI for precise drawing control
- Using Core Graphics for accurate rink rendering
- Core Data for drill storage with manual code generation
- Will use PencilKit for natural Apple Pencil experience

- Target iPad Pro for optimal Apple Pencil workflow

### Development Reminders
- Maintain NHL regulation proportions in all screen sizes
- Test on actual iPad with Apple Pencil regularly
- Keep drawing performance optimized for smooth interaction
- Plan for professional-quality export from the beginning
